# VLSI-Codes
# VLSI Design & Digital Systems – BE SPPU

This repository contains structured Verilog/VHDL implementations 
and digital design modules developed as part of the BE Electronics 
and Telecommunication Engineering (SPPU) curriculum.

The objective of this repository is to strengthen hardware-level 
understanding, digital logic design skills, and RTL modeling concepts.
